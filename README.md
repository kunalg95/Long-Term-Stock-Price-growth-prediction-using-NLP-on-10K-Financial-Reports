# Long-Term-Stock-Price-growth-prediction-using-NLP-on-10K-Financial-Reports

Every year, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requests a 10-K Financial report from all publicly traded corporations outlining their financial performance.<br/>
The 10-k records include details on corporate operations, risk considerations, particular financial statistics, the Management Discussion, and supplemental data.<br/>

The words in the dictionary were chosen with the context of financial reports in mind.<br/>

It is my responsibility to create an NLP pipeline that ingests 10-K reports from multiple publicly listed firms and to create a machine learning model that can extract hidden signals from the 10-K documents and predict a company's long-term stock performance.
